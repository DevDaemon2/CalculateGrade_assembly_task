# CalculateGrade_assembly_task

Test Score Evaluation
Create a procedure named CalcGrade that receives an integer value between 0 and 75, and returns a single capital letter in the AL register. Preserve all other register values between calls to the procedure. The letter returned by the procedure should be displayed and should be according to the following
ranges:
Score 70 to 75  Grade A
Score 60 to 69  Grade B
Score 50 to 59 Grade C
Score 0 to 49 Grade F
Write a test program that
1. asks the user to enter integer between 0 and 75, inclusive.   If the user enters invalid number, please display error message.
2. Pass it to the CalcGrade procedure. 
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three times so that you collect three scores from the user and display the respective grade for each score.
